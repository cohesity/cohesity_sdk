**name** | **str, none_type** | Specifies the name of the View. | [optional] 
**category** | **str, none_type** | Specifies the category of the View. | [optional] 
**protocol_access** | [**[ViewProtocol], none_type**](ViewProtocol.md) | Specifies the supported Protocols for the View. | [optional] 
**qos** | **{str: (bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type)}** | Specifies the Quality of Service (QoS) Policy for the View. | [optional] 
**override_global_subnet_whitelist** | **bool, none_type** | Specifies whether view level client subnet whitelist overrides cluster and global setting. | [optional] 
**subnet_whitelist** | [**[Subnet], none_type**](Subnet.md) | Array of Subnets. Specifies a list of Subnets with IP addresses that have permissions to access the View. (Overrides or extends the Subnets specified at the global Cohesity Cluster level.) | [optional] 
**override_global_netgroup_whitelist** | **bool, none_type** | Specifies whether view level client netgroup whitelist overrides cluster and global setting. | [optional] 
**netgroup_whitelist** | **{str: (bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type)}** | Array of Netgroups. Specifies a list of netgroups with domains that have permissions to access the View. (Overrides or extends the Netgroup specified at the global Cohesity Cluster level.) | [optional] 
**security_mode** | **str, none_type** | Specifies the security mode used for this view. Currently we support the following modes: Native, Unified and NTFS style. &#39;NativeMode&#39; indicates a native security mode. &#39;UnifiedMode&#39; indicates a unified security mode. &#39;NtfsMode&#39; indicates a NTFS style security mode. | [optional]

(Logical data is when the data is fully hydrated and expanded.) This limit overrides the limit inherited from the Storage Domain (View Box) (if set). If logicalQuota is nil, the limit is inherited from the Storage Domain (View Box) (if set). A new write is not allowed if the Storage Domain (View Box) will exceed the specified quota. However, it takes time for the Cohesity Cluster to calculate the usage across Nodes, so the limit may be exceeded by a small amount. In addition, if the limit is increased or data is removed, there may be a delay before the Cohesity Cluster allows more data to be written to the View, as the Cluster is calculating the usage across Nodes. | [optional] 
**file_lock_config** | **{str: (bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type)}** | Optional config that enables file locking for this view. It cannot be disabled during the edit of a view, if it has been enabled during the creation of the view. Also, it cannot be enabled if it was disabled during the creation of the view. | [optional]
