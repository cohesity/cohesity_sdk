# AwsSnapshotManagerProtectionGroupParams

Specifies the parameters which are specific to AWS related Protection Groups using AWS native snapshot orchestration with snapshot manager. Atlease one of tags or objects must be specified.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ami_creation_frequency** | **int, none_type** | The frequency of AMI creation. This should be set if the option to create AMI is set. A value of n creates an AMI from the snapshots after every n runs. eg. n &#x3D; 2 implies every alternate backup run starting from the first will create an AMI. | [optional] 
**create_ami** | **bool, none_type** | Specifies whether AMI should be created after taking snapshots of the instance. | [optional] 
**exclude_object_ids** | **[int], none_type** | Specifies the objects to be excluded in the Protection Group. | [optional] 
**exclude_vm_tag_ids** | **[[int]]** | Array of Arrays of VM Tag Ids that Specify VMs to Exclude. Optionally specify a list of VMs to exclude from protecting by listing Protection Source ids of VM Tags in this two dimensional array. Using this two dimensional array of Tag ids, the Cluster generates a list of VMs to exclude from protecting, which are derived from intersections of the inner arrays and union of the outer array, as shown by the following example. For example a Datacenter is selected to be protected but you want to exclude all the &#39;Former Employees&#39; VMs in the East and West but keep all the VMs for &#39;Former Employees&#39; in the South which are also stored in this Datacenter, by specifying the following tag id array: [ [1000, 2221], [1000, 3031] ], where 1000 is the &#39;Former Employee&#39; VM Tag id, 2221 is the &#39;East&#39; VM Tag id and 3031 is the &#39;West&#39; VM Tag id. The first inner array [1000, 2221] produces a list of VMs that are both tagged with &#39;Former Employees&#39; and &#39;East&#39; (an intersection). The second inner array [1000, 3031] produces a list of VMs that are both tagged with &#39;Former Employees&#39; and &#39;West&#39; (an intersection). The outer array combines the list of VMs from the two inner arrays. The list of resulting VMs are excluded from being protected this Job. | [optional] 
**objects** | [**[AwsSnapshotManagerProtectionGroupObjectParams]**](AwsSnapshotManagerProtectionGroupObjectParams.md) | Specifies the objects to be included in the Protection Group. | [optional] 
**source_id** | **int, none_type** | Specifies the id of the parent of the objects. | [optional] [readonly] 
**source_name** | **str, none_type** | Specifies the name of the parent of the objects. | [optional] [readonly] 
**vm_tag_ids** | **[[int]], none_type** | Array of Array of VM Tag Ids that Specify VMs to Protect. Optionally specify a list of VMs to protect by listing Protection Source ids of VM Tags in this two dimensional array. Using this two dimensional array of Tag ids, the Cluster generates a list of VMs to protect which are derived from intersections of the inner arrays and union of the outer array, as shown by the following example. To protect only &#39;Eng&#39; VMs in the East and all the VMs in the West, specify the following tag id array: [ [1101, 2221], [3031] ], where 1101 is the &#39;Eng&#39; VM Tag id, 2221 is the &#39;East&#39; VM Tag id and 3031 is the &#39;West&#39; VM Tag id. The inner array [1101, 2221] produces a list of VMs that are both tagged with &#39;Eng&#39; and &#39;East&#39; (an intersection). The outer array combines the list from the inner array with list of VMs tagged with &#39;West&#39; (a union). The list of resulting VMs are protected by this Protection Group. | [optional] 
**volume_exclusion_params** | [**EbsVolumeExclusionParams**](EbsVolumeExclusionParams.md) |  | [optional]
