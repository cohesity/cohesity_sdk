## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**view_id** | **int, none_type** | Specifies an id of the View assigned by the Cohesity Cluster. | [optional] [readonly] 
**is_category_inferred** | **bool, none_type** | If True, category in response is not set by user but inferred by Iris because none is set. Category can only be none when view was created by v1 API or cloned from a view created by v1 API.  Inference Logic is as follows: 1. Object Services if only S3 or Swift protocol is selected. 2. Backup Target only if one read-write protocol is selected and    QoS is \&quot;Backup Target Commvault\&quot; or \&quot;Backup Target SSD\&quot;. 3. File Services if there are more than 1 read-write protocol or    it doesn&#39;t fit any other category. | [optional] [readonly] 
**data_lock_expiry_usecs** | **int, none_type** | DataLock (Write Once Read Many) lock expiry epoch time in microseconds. If a view is marked as a DataLock view, only a Data Security Officer (a user having Data Security Privilege) can delete the view until the lock expiry time. | [optional]

Currently we support the following modes: Native, Unified and NTFS style. &#39;NativeMode&#39; indicates a native security mode. &#39;UnifiedMode&#39; indicates a unified security mode. &#39;NtfsMode&#39; indicates a NTFS style security mode. | [optional]

However, it takes time for the Cohesity Cluster to calculate the usage across Nodes, so the limit may be exceeded by a small amount. In addition, if the limit is increased or data is removed, there may be a delay before the Cohesity Cluster allows more data to be written to the View, as the Cluster is calculating the usage across Nodes. | [optional]
