Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**metadata_file_path** | **str, none_type** | Specifies metadata file path during run-now requests for physical file based backups for some specific source. If specified, it will override any default metadata/directive file path set at the object level for the source. Also note that if the job default does not specify a metadata/directive file path for the source, then specifying this field for that source during run-now request will be rejected. | [optional]
