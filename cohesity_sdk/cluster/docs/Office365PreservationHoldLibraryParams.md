# Office365PreservationHoldLibraryParams

Specifies the parameters specific to the protection of the Preservation Hold library. The Preservation Hold library is a hidden system location that isn't designed to be used interactively but instead, automatically stores files when this is needed for compliance reasons. It's not supported to edit, delete, or move these automatically retained files yourself. Instead, use compliance tools, such as those supported by eDiscovery to access these files.
