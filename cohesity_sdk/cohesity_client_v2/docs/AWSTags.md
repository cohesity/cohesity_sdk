**vm_tag_ids** | **[[int]], none_type** | Array of Arrays of VMs Tags Ids that Specify VMs to Protect. Optionally specify a list of VMs to protect by listing Protection Source ids of VM Tags in this two dimensional array. Using this two dimensional array of Tag ids, the Cluster generates a list of VMs to protect which are derived from intersections of the inner arrays and union of the outer array, as shown by the following example. To protect only &#39;Eng&#39; VMs in the East and all the VMs in the West, specify the following tag id array: [ [1101, 2221], [3031] ], where 1101 is the &#39;Eng&#39; VM Tag id, 2221 is the &#39;East&#39; VM Tag id and 3031 is the &#39;West&#39; VM Tag id. The inner array [1101, 2221] produces a list of VMs that are both tagged with &#39;Eng&#39; and &#39;East&#39; (an intersection). The outer array combines the list from the inner array with list of VMs tagged with &#39;West&#39; (a union). The list of resulting VMs are protected by this Protection Group. | [optional]
